    <note>Dwelly: amadan-Bealltainn sm Whimbrel, May-fowl {numenius phaeopus}. Very numerous in the Western Isles during the first fortnight in May, on their migration north. They are not
      distinguishable from the curlew to the uninitiated, but unlike that bird they will allow strangers to approach to well within gun-shot. Hence their name.</note>
